    <p> Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones was born in the Brooklyn borough of New York City on September 14, 1973, to African 
      American parents. His father, Olu Dara (born Charles Jones III), is a jazz and blues musician from Mississippi. 
      His mother, Fannie Ann was a U.S. Postal Service worker from North Carolina.</p>

    <p> He has a brother, Jabari Fret, who raps under the name Jungle and is a member of the hip hop group Bravehearts. His father adopted the name "Olu Dara" from 
      the Yoruba people. "Nasir" is an Arabic name meaning "helper and protector", while "bin" means "son of" in Arabic. 
      He is a cousin of actors Yara Shahidi and Sayeed Shahidi.</p>

      
<p> As a young child, Nas and his family relocated to the Queensbridge Houses in the borough of Queens. 
      His neighbor, Willy "Ill Will" Graham, influenced his interest in hip hop by playing him records. 
      His parents divorced in 1985, and he dropped out of school after the eighth grade.</p>

    <p> In 2012, The Source ranked him second on their list of the "Top 50 Lyricists of All Time". In 2013, 
      Nas was ranked 4th on MTV's "Hottest MCs in the Game" list. About.com ranked him first on their list 
      of the "50 Greatest MCs of All Time" in 2014, and a year later, Nas was featured on the "10 Best Rappers 
      of All Time" list by Billboard. He is also an entrepreneur through his own record label; he serves as 
      associate publisher of Mass Appeal magazine.</p>

      <h3>Controversies and Feuds</h3>

         <p>Initially friends, Nas and Jay-Z had met a number of times in the 1990s with no animosity between the two. 
            Jay-Z requested that Nas appear on his 1996 album Reasonable Doubt on the track "Bring it On", 
            Nas never showed up to the studio and was not included on the album. In response to this, Jay-Z asked 
            producer Ski Beatz to sample a line from Nas's song "The World is Yours", with the sample featured heavily 
            in what went on to be "Dead Presidents II".</p>

         </figure>
      <p>The two traded subliminal responses for the next couple of years, until the beef was escalated further in 2001 
         after Jay-Z publicly addressed Nas at the Summer Jam, performing what would go on to be known as "Takeover", 
         ending the performance by saying "ask Nas, he don't want it with Hov". After Jay-Z eventually released the song 
         on his 2001 album The Blueprint, Nas responded with the song "Ether", from his album Stillmatic, with both fans 
         and critics saying that the song had effectively saved Nas's career and marked his return to prominence, and 
         almost unanimously agreeing Nas had won their feud.</p>
      <p>In the song, Jay-Z makes reference to Nas's girlfriend and daughter, going into graphic detail about having an 
         affair with his girlfriend. Jay-Z's mother was personally disgusted by the song and demanded he apologize to Nas 
         and his family, which he did in December 2001 on Hot 97. "Supa Ugly" marked the last direct diss song between 
         Jay-Z and Nas. The two continued to trade subliminals on their subsequent releases. The feud was 
         officially brought to an end in 2005 when Jay-Z and Nas performed on stage together in a surprise concert.</p>

      <p>On April 10, 2013, Nas invested an undisclosed six-figure sum into Mass Appeal magazine, where he went on to serve as the publication's associate publisher, joined by creative firm Decon and White Owl Capital Partners. In June 2013, he opened his own sneaker store. In September 2013, he invested in a technology startup company, a job search app maker called Proven. In 2014, Nas invested as part of a $2.8M round in viral video startup ViralGains.</p>
      <p>In May 2014, Nas partnered with job placement startup Koru to fund a scholarship for 10 college graduates to go through Koru's training program. Nas also joined the startup as a guest coach. Nas is a co-owner of a cloud-based service LANDR, an automated, drag-and-drop digital audio postproduction tool that automates "mastering", the final stage in audio production.</p>
      <p>In June 2018, Nas received $40 million after Amazon acquired the doorbell company Ring Inc., as well as PillPack, the latter of which he invested in via his investment firm, Queensbridge Venture Partners. He has continued to invest heavily in technology startups including Dropbox, Lyft, and Robinhood.</p>
